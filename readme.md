This is a simple crud with node, express, sequelizer and postgress mounted on docker-compose.

This was created just for fun and learning.

Usage:

``docker-compose up -d nsp_db

``docker-compose build

``docker-compose up -d nsp_backend

You can test with tools like postman to create, read, update and delete users.
